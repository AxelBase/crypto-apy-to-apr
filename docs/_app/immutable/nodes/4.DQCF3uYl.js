This choice is deliberate and reflects the reality of how rewards work in staking and DeFi protocols.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The fundamental difference lies in compounding. APR represents the simple annual interest rate without accounting for compounding effects. APY, on the other hand, shows the effective annual yield when interest is added back to the principal multiple times per year.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">In traditional finance, compounding might occur monthly or quarterly. In crypto, it often happens daily or even more frequently. For example, Ethereum staking rewards compound continuously as validators earn block rewards. Similarly, many DeFi lending platforms like Aave or Compound automatically reinvest interest.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">This frequent compounding creates a significant gap between APR and APY. A 10% APR compounded daily results in approximately 10.52% APY. Over time, this difference becomes substantial, especially with higher rates or larger principals.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why Crypto Uses APY</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Crypto projects prefer quoting APY because it presents a more accurate picture of what users will actually earn. An APR quote would understate the true return, potentially making the platform appear less competitive.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">However, this can lead to confusion when comparing opportunities. Some platforms might quote APR for borrowing rates while showing APY for lending returns. Others might switch between the two depending on market conditions.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Understanding this distinction helps investors make better decisions. When evaluating staking rewards on networks like Solana, Cardano, or Polkadot, always consider how frequently rewards compound. The same nominal rate can produce very different outcomes depending on the compounding schedule.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">DeFi yield farming adds another layer. Liquidity providers often receive rewards that compound automatically within the protocol. Here, APY becomes essential for understanding real returns after impermanent loss and fees.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The converter tool allows you to see these differences instantly. Enter any rate and adjust the compounding frequency to match the specific protocol you are researching.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">APY always equals or exceeds APR when compounding occurs</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Daily compounding is standard in most crypto staking</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Higher compounding frequency increases the effective yield</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Always verify how a platform calculates and compounds rewards</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">By focusing on APY for compounded returns and APR for simple rates, you can compare opportunities more accurately across the crypto ecosystem.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The gap between APR and APY grows exponentially with higher rates. At 20% APR daily compounded, the APY reaches over 22.1%. This compounding effect is why many high-yield crypto opportunities appear even more attractive when properly measured.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Next time you see a staking reward advertised, remember that the real return is likely higher than the simple APR suggests, thanks to the power of compounding in blockchain networks.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Use the converter to explore how different rates and frequencies affect your potential returns.</p></article></div>');function M(d){var e=q();w("1tq17n3",h=>{var r=P(),u=y(f(r),6);t(4),s(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),g(()=>{v.title="Why APY Matters More Than APR in Crypto | Crypto APY ↔ APR Converter"}),n(h,r)});var a=o(e),m=o(a);t(4),i(a),t(2),i(e),s(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(d,e)}export{M as component,C as universal};
