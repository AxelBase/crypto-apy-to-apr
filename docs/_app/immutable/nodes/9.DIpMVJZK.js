When utilization is high, rates increase. These rates usually compound frequently as interest accrues continuously.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Most major protocols like Aave, Compound, and Maker display APY for suppliers and borrowers. This reflects the effective yield or cost after compounding effects.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Lenders earn interest that compounds automatically. A quoted 8% APY means suppliers receive that effective annual return as interest adds back to their position regularly.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Borrowers pay interest that also compounds. Their debt grows over time based on the borrowing APY, making the true cost higher than a simple APR quote would suggest.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Key Differences in Practice</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Variable rates dominate DeFi lending. Rates change based on pool utilization, creating fluctuating APY that requires constant monitoring.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Stablecoin lending often shows lower but more consistent APY. Volatile asset pairs can produce extremely high yields during market stress but with increased risk.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Some protocols offer dual rates. Suppliers see lending APY while borrowers face borrowing APY. The spread between these covers protocol fees and reserves.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Flash loans and leveraged positions complicate calculations further. Borrowers using leverage must account for compounded borrowing costs against their position returns.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Yield farming strategies often combine lending APY with additional token rewards. Total effective APY includes both components and requires careful calculation.</p> <h3 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Important Considerations</h3> <ul class="svelte-q8x3kg"><li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Lending APY compounds automatically in most protocols</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Borrowing costs grow exponentially with time due to compounding</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Variable rates mean quoted APY changes frequently</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Liquidation risks increase with higher borrowing rates</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Protocol fees reduce net lending yields</li></ul> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Use the converter to understand base rates behind advertised APY. Convert lending APY to APR for comparison with traditional finance options.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Monitor utilization ratios closely. High utilization pushes borrowing costs up dramatically while increasing lender returns.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">DeFi lending demonstrates why APY provides the most accurate picture for both suppliers and borrowers in dynamic rate environments.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">In DeFi, compounding makes the real cost and reward very different from simple rates.</p></article></div>');function F(p){var e=q();w("q8x3kg",m=>{var a=y(),u=v(h(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),f(()=>{k.title="APY vs APR in DeFi Lending and Borrowing | Crypto APY ↔ APR Converter"}),r(m,a)});var s=n(e),g=n(s);t(4),i(s),t(2),i(e),o(()=>l(g,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(p,e)}export{F as component,R as universal};
